## Advice to self if I do a project like this again

I'm really proud of the progress I made in this project, and I think I used class time really well. Though if I were to do another big project like this one the advice I'd give to myself is to try to do more uniqe things. I'm pretty happy with how this project turned out, I achieved my goal. But for future projects I want to get more creative and not just remake another game.

## Hardest Part of Project

The hardest part of this project was making the shop/upgrade shop (which makes sense because purchasable upgrades and buildings are the core of a cookie clicker game). It was mainly a struggle to get the shop to properly display, it had a few errors but wasn't a huge problem for too long

## Did you Complete the Needs to Have List?

Yes, the cookie, shop, cps, and music were all added like I listed in my "must have list" I almost got everything in my "nice to have list" but didn't have enough time to add the milk multipliers

## What are you Most Proud of?

I'm most proud of the fact that I achieved my goal of making a fully functional game, I wanted to make a game that felt complete. I wanted to be able to play my own game and think "this game doesn't feel like it's missing something". Not saying there's no room to improve, I can still add more upgrades/buildings and I can still add music whith volume options, and even more. But there's nothing that isn't in the game that it needs to have to be called "complete"
